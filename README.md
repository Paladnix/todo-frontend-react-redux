# TODO List frontend with react & redux

As the first react & redux project, it take me 4 days to make it be a page just barely to use but just barely.

It has realized functions list below:

- Add a task with `description`, `priority`, 'expire time'.
- Mark a task with status of `DOWN` or `TODO`, default `TODO`.
- Delete a task by click the `x` at the end of each row.
- Filter task by the status: `DOWN`, `TODO`, `ALL`.
- Sort task by their `priority` or `expire time`. But this function is not flexible because it just can sort it with descending order.

The next function that I need to do is `Update the taski detail`. 
However I am not familier with the operation of html and has not get a suitable way to realize it.
